# Graphed-and-Organized
This program uses data from a csv collected by my previous repository (Gas Price for 'wxyz' trxn. speed, at 'd' datetime).
Using this collected gas and time data, this program transforms the csv as necessary to create graphs and calculate numbers that can serve as a foundation for deeper analysis.
